\section{CONCLUSION}
In this work, we propose  an approach using functional data analysis to tackle the problem of estimating geodesic distances for manifold data in noisy settings.

Discuss the main advantages of the proposed framework in comparison to other methods.

Discuss some limited of the current suggested approach and ideas for improvement.
